# Bit Heroes Hunger Games Bot Remake

This is a general contest bot based on Shadown's original Hunger Games bot used by the Bit Heroes community.

A sponsor begins the a game by issuing the `/hg-start` slash command, which starts a competition. Contestants enter by reacting to the bot with a specific Ô∏èemoji.

After `start-delay` seconds, the game commences with players being eliminated regularly until `victors` competitors remain.

## Running the Bot

This bot is written in go. See [go.dev](https://go.dev/) for installation instructions.

After cloning this repository, create a file in the root directory called `.env` and copy these lines into it:

```bash
export BITHEROES_HG_BOT_AUTH_TOKEN=
export BITHEROES_HG_BOT_EMOJI_NAME=
export BITHEROES_HG_BOT_EMOJI_ID=
```

You'll need to create an application, and then a bot under that application, on the Discord developer site. Enter the new bot's authorization token after the `BITHEROES_HG_BOT_AUTH_TOKEN=` line above.

Next you'll need to set the emoji name and ID equal to the reaction emoji that you'd like to use for the bot. 
* The emoji name is easy to find, just hover above it after it's been sent to a channel.
* To find the ID, right click on the emoji in a channel and select Copy Link. Use the webp file name without the extension as the ID. For example for the URL `https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1084494508248543383.webp?size=96&quality=lossless` use `1084494508248543383`.

Afterward start the bot by running:

```bash
make run 
```

## Running Tests

While test coverage is slim at the moment, running tests is worthwhile after adding new phrases to test that they can be parsed properly.

Run tests using make:

```bash
make test
```

## Adding New Phrases

The death phrases are imported from `data/phrases.en.json` file and can use the following tokens:

* `{{.Dying}}`: The player that is dying.
* `{{.Killer}}`: A random living player that contributed to the dying player's death.
